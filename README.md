## Veg me please!
### By David Kim
Did you ever not want to eat meat? no? Well shut up because too much meat is bad for you! Vegetarians have one thing going for them and it's eating [more] veggies. More and more people are catching on to the vegetarian wave and though there are so many recipes online to check out, where does a vegetarian newbie start? Where do they go? If they just went to Trader Joes or whole foods and left with a bag of raw organic kale, they'll swear vegetarianism off forever while they munch on a whopper to get the taste out and crying because of their poor, empty wallets.

BUT WAIT!

There's Veg Me Please!! It's a brand spanking new app that will help you make vegetarian choices! Enter a few parameters and a veggie that you like and then BOOM! Recipes! Recipes for all!

note 4/3/2014: I was having issues with the API this evening. Though my code was correct, the API did not recognize any additional parameters to the search call. Chuck and Ilana can vouch for this problem
